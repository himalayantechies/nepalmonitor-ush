== Description ==
Share reports among deployments. A rebooted version of the core sharing plugin.
This plugin handles shared reports more like core reports:

* Added to the same layer on the map
* Visible in the reports listing
* Reports filterable by category
* Reports viewing in the current site, rather than always redirecting to the original site

Incompatible with: Sharing, Actionable

Config options:
* Default to showing all sites reports / showing this sites reports
* Show reports in this site / Redirect rpeorts to origin site
* Ignore reports not in match category / Create missing categories
(not sure if we'll show category-less reports in 'all categories')
